1. Update
2. Notes:
  * Height of footer reduced to a smaller size
  * second page now has a return-to-previous-page option. However whenever you choose to return to the homepage, it just directs you to the index again. So you're basically 
     not returning to the previous page but forwarded again to the homepage
  * summary of company/services were added to the front page along with bg images
3. Recommendations
  * Since the "Our Services" section was added, we maybe could add more info around each service
  * Since the "contact us" section was also added, we might need to add a form for the user to contact us
  * Smoother transitions between each section of the website could be good, as well as more info in the about us section too
